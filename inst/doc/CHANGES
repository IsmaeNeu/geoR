  What's geoR:
  -------------
    geoR is a package to perform geostatistical data analysis and 
    spatial prediction, expanding the tools already available in 
    R for analysis of spatial data.

  Legalese:
  ---------
  geoR is distributed under the same terms as R:

  "geoR is available as Free Software under the terms of the Free Software 
   Foundation's GNU General Public License."
   As free package, geoR is supplied without any warranty. 

  History:
  --------
  geoR has been developed over the last two years in the Dept of Maths 
  and Stats, Lancaster University - UK.
  
  During this period it has being used for teaching short courses and 
  for data analysis. Some scientific publications has been written, 
  using the resources provided by the package.
  
  The package has been available on the web and there is already a 
  reasonable number of users, considering the e-mails received about 
  usage/bugs/help.


  How does it differ from the current resources?
  ----------------------------------------------
  geoR differs in some aspects of the currently available tools for 
  geostatistical data analysis: the package sgeostats and the functions 
  included in the VR's spatial package.
  
  The main differences are the implementation of methods for likelihood 
  based estimation and Bayesian prediction of (transformed) Gaussian 
  random fields.


  The target audience:
  ---------------------
  This is always hard to predict. 
  Based on the feedback we've got so far we can say that the package 
  has been mainly used as:
  - teaching support tool for courses on geostatistics
  - data analysis tool for statisticians working on applied problems 
    as well as researchers in soil and environmental sciences, 
    biology, among others
  - support tool for simulation studies


  Extra documentation:
  ---------------------
  The package web page is: 
                www.maths.lancs.ac.uk/~ribeiro/geoR.html

  For a quick visualization of its functionality:
                www.maths.lancs.ac.uk/~ribeiro/geoRintro.html

  A pdf version of the latter is included in the package distribution as: 
                docs/geoRintro.pdf


  The distribution file and tests:
  --------------------------------
  The current distribution includes documentation for all the functions.
  It has passed "R CMD check" (R-devel, 1.3.0)


  Future developments:
  --------------------
  The file "docs/ToDo.geoR" has a list of features which should be 
  implemented in short/medium term.


  Related resources/work:
  -----------------------
  There is a joint work in progress with Ole Christensen (Aalborg 
  University, Denmark) to implement non-Gaussian spatial models.
  It's not yet clear whether this will results in a package on its own 
  or will be an expansion of the geoR functionality. 
  Ole has given a great contribution for geoR development, and we 
  therefore expect total compatibility of the resulting product 
  with geoR.

  Martin Schlather (Bayreuth University, Germany) is writing a package 
  for simulation of Gaussian random fields. We will be in touch with 
  Martin trying to improve the compatibility between the two packages.
